### _Emergency Medical Accessibility Analysis_ | Fall 2020
`#Health Economics` `#Regression` `#Commercial API` `#Undergraduate Research` `#Python`

[Source Codes](https://github.com/hyeong01/Emergency-Medical-Accessibility) <br>
[Research Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oxgDFhnuKv_zIlZ9ixoEksBy26_LSX7C/view)

Analyzed the inequalities in medical accessibility by region and its implications
- Investigated 1,000 samples per each region from the database for all Korean addresses, with a total of 17 regions.
- Using a commercial navigation API, calcuated the time to get from each address to the nearest emergency medical facility.
- Analyzed the relationship between the average accessibilty time and medical service index such as the survival rate from heart attacks. 
- Removed the effects of other potential variables through regression.
- Conclusion: emergency medical accessibility differs signifcantly by region, and the difference is likely affecting its fatality rate.
- A comprehensive project involving economics, statistics, data preprocessing, and programming.
